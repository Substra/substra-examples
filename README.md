# Substra Examples

The purpose of this repository is to gather community driven examples of Substra use cases in order to provide extra pedagogical materials to the official [Substra examples](https://github.com/SubstraFoundation/substra/tree/master/examples).

> :warning: **Please note that these examples are maintained with a best effort policy by the community, implying that everything might not be perfectly up-to-date.**

Still, you should find some perks helping you grasp the Substra framework.
